Analysis of Breast Cancer

I have conducted a comprehensive analysis of global breast cancer statistics. The focus of this study was to investigate the prevalence of breast cancer on a worldwide scale. The analysis involved examining the number of individuals diagnosed with breast cancer across different countries and identifying those with the highest rates of diagnosis. Additionally, I aimed to explore the mortality rates associated with various types of breast cancer in different regions.

Moreover, the analysis extended to examining how breast cancer cases vary based on factors such as race, age, and tumor size measured in millimeters. The insights gathered from this research are detailed in the README file, providing a thorough understanding of the global landscape of breast cancer and shedding light on the diverse impacts of the disease across different populations.
